**57. You may make a left turn on a red light only from a:**

> One-way street onto a one-way street.

You may turn left against a red light when you are turning from a one-way street onto a one-way street. Make sure there is no sign prohibiting the turn. Yield to other vehicles, pedestrians, or bicyclists who have a green light. Look both ways and turn when it is safe.

**63. You should increase the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead when you:**

> Are being tailgated by another driver.

When being tailgated, create extra space in front of your vehicle and do not brake suddenly. Slow down gradually or merge into another lane to prevent a collision with the tailgater.

**66. If your vehicle starts to lose traction because of water on the road, you should:**

> Slow down gradually and not apply the brakes.

When driving in heavy rain at speeds as low as 30 mph, your tires may lose all contact with the road and instead ride up on a layer of water above the surface of the road. This is called "hydroplaning." If your vehicle starts to hydroplane, slow down gradually and do not apply the brakes.

**83. If a green arrow turns into a solid green light, you:**

> May still turn, but you must yield to oncoming traffic.

If a green arrow turns into a solid green light, you may still turn in the direction that the arrow was pointing but you must first yield to pedestrians and oncoming traffic.

**93. At an intersection with a stop sign, you should stop and:**

> Look left first, then right, then left again.

When stopped at an intersection, you should first look to your left, as vehicles coming from the left are closer to you than vehicles coming from the right. Look to your right, then look to your left again, in case there are any vehicles coming from that direction that you did not see at first glance.

**95. Allow a larger space cushion than usual when stopping:**

> On an incline. 【incline 倾斜】

You should allow more space in front of your vehicle than usual when you are stopped on an uphill slope. If the vehicle in front of you rolls backward toward your vehicle when traffic begins to move again, it is less likely that there will be a collision.

**100. You are waiting in the intersection to complete a left turn. You should:**

> Signal and keep your wheels straight.

You must always signal before turning or changing lanes. You should keep your wheels straight while waiting to make a left turn. If another vehicle hits you from behind, this ensures that you will not be pushed into oncoming traffic.

**107. If you experience a tire blowout:**

> Slow down gradually and use your brakes lightly.

If you experience a tire blowout, you should slow down gradually by taking your foot off of the accelerator. Don't apply the brakes until the vehicle has slowed considerably.

**108. In rainy weather, you should be most careful when turning or stopping:**

> During the first half hour of rain.

You should be extra careful when turning and stopping during the first half hour of rain. At this point, the oil from cars has not yet washed off the pavement and could be forming a slippery mixture with the rain.

**111. When encountering an aggressive driver, you should:**

> Avoid eye contact, slow down, and let them pass.

If another driver is threatening you or intentionally driving dangerously around you, remain calm and try to put as much distance between the two of you as possible. Slow down and let them pass. Do not make eye contact and do not make obscene gestures.

**118. Guide signs are ____ signs that provide directional and mileage information to drivers.**

> Green

Guide signs, sometimes known as destination signs, have a green background and provide directional and mileage information to specific destinations. They can be a helpful resource when driving in unfamiliar locations.

**119. Regulatory【监管】 signs are usually ____ and should always be obeyed.**

> White

Regulatory signs regulate the movement of traffic. They are usually white with black markings and must always be obeyed by motorists.

**120. Pennant-shaped【三角旗】 signs indicate:**

> No passing zones.

Pennant-shaped signs usually indicate no passing zones. Text will also be on the sign to confirm that it is a no passing zone.

**121. Pentagonal【五边形】 signs indicate:**

> School zones.

Pentagonal signs indicate that you are in a school zone. Be extra alert to children and pedestrians when driving near a school.

**122. An octagonal【八角形】 sign is always a:**

> Stop sign.

Octagonal signs are always stop signs. Come to a complete stop when approaching a red, eight-sided sign.

**123. A diamond-shaped【菱形】 sign:**

> Warns of existing or possible hazards.

Diamond-shaped signs warn drivers of existing or potential driving hazards. You will usually see these signs in yellow or orange.

**133. If you are driving in another driver's blind spot, you should:**

> Move forward or drop back so the other driver can see you.

Do not drive in someone else’s blind spot. Move forward or drop back so that the other driver can see you.

**137. Motorcycles are entitled to:**

> The same full lane width as other motor vehicles.

Lane usage for the motorcyclist is critical. Motorcycles are entitled to the same full lane width as all other vehicles.

**145. Downward-facing triangular【倒三角】 signs:**

> Tell drivers to yield.

Downward-facing triangular signs usually indicate that drivers should yield. Once the road is clear of traffic or pedestrians and it is safe to do so, drivers may proceed.

**146. Round signs【圆形】 indicate:**

> Upcoming railroad crossings.

Round signs warn drivers of an upcoming railroad crossing area. Drivers should use extra caution when approaching a railroad crossing.
