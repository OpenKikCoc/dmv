> pickup truck 皮卡车

**2. To see vehicles in your blind spots, you should check: Over your shoulders.**

> When passing another vehicle that is traveling in the same direction as you, pass quickly to resume visibility. Return to your previous lane only when you can see both of the vehicle's headlights in your rearview mirror. 超越同向行驶的车辆时，应快速超车以确保后方视野。只有当您能从后视镜中看到对方车辆的前后车灯时，才能返回原车道。

**5. California's 【Move Over law】 requires: All vehicles to vacate the lane closest to an emergency vehicle that is stopped with its lights flashing. 所有车辆应驶离距离闪烁警示灯的紧急车辆最近的车道。**

> To stay aware of hazards, you should scan the road and check your rearview mirrors every two to five seconds. Constantly staring at just the road ahead of you is dangerous. If you must drive in foggy conditions, you should use your low beam headlights, not your high beam headlights. 为了时刻注意路况，你应该每隔两到五秒钟扫视一下路面并查看后视镜。一直盯着前方道路行驶是很危险的。如果必须在雾天行驶，你应该使用近光灯，而不是远光灯。

**8. If you drive faster than other vehicles on a road with one lane moving in each direction and continually pass the other cars, you will**
- Get you to your destination much more quickly and safely.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Increase your chances of an collision.</span>
- Help prevent traffic congestion.

> You should avoid passing other vehicles on two-lane roads. Every time you pass a vehicle, your odds of being in a collision increase. 在双车道道路上，应避免超车。每次超车都会增加发生碰撞的概率。

**9. To avoid last-minute moves, you should be looking down the road to where your vehicle will be in about:【last-minute 10-15s】**
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ 5 to 10 seconds.</span>
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ 10 to 15 seconds.</span>
- 15 to 20 seconds.

> To avoid last-minute moves, you should scan the road 10 to 15 seconds ahead of your vehicle. This allows you to see hazards before meeting them. 为了避免临阵脱逃，你应该在车辆行驶前10到15秒观察路况。这样可以让你在遇到危险之前就发现它们。

**10. Water on the road can cause a vehicle to hydroplane. Your car may hydroplane at speeds as low as:【水滑现象 35mph】**
- 45 miles per hour.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ 35 miles per hour.</span>
- 40 miles per hour.

> Hydroplaning occurs when there is standing water on a roadway. At speeds up to 35 mph, most tires will channel water away from the tire. As your speed increases past 35 mph, tires cannot channel the water as well and your tires may start to lose contact with the road and ride over the water like a set of water skis. 水滑现象是指车辆在路面有积水时发生的现象。车速在35英里/小时（约56公里/小时）以下时，大多数轮胎都能有效地将水排出。但当车速超过35英里/小时后，轮胎的排水能力会下降，轮胎可能会失去与路面的接触，像滑水板一样在水面上滑行。

**14. What is the benefit of a space cushion around your vehicle?**
- Other drivers can cut in front of you, improving the flow of traffic.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ If another driver makes a mistake, you have time to react.</span>
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ It inflates to protect you from injury in the case of a collision.</span>

> Keeping space around your vehicle is important to ensure that you have time to safely react if another driver makes a mistake. For example, extra space around your vehicle may give you time to brake or maneuver out of the way of a vehicle veering into your lane. 保持与车辆周围的安全距离非常重要，这样才能确保您有时间在其他驾驶员犯错时安全应对。例如，额外的安全距离可以让您有时间刹车或避让突然变道的车辆。

**16. Continuous hard braking on ice and snow often: Locks the front wheels of a vehicle, causing a loss of steering.**

> Continuous hard braking on snow and ice can result in the locking of the front brake, causing a loss of steering. To avoid the need for excessive braking, make sure to maintain an appropriate speed for conditions. 在冰雪路面上频繁急刹车会导致前轮抱死，从而造成转向失控。为避免过度刹车，请务必根据路况保持适当的车速。

**24. California's "Basic Speed Law" says you must**
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Keep your speed close to that of other traffic.</span>
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions.</span>
- Always drive at the posted speed limit.

> The "Basic Speed Law" states that you may never drive faster than is safe for current conditions. For example, if you drive at 45 mph in a 55 mph zone during a dense fog, even though you are below the posted limit, you may be cited for driving "too fast for conditions." “基本速度法”规定，您不得以超过当前路况安全速度行驶。例如，如果您在限速 55 英里/小时的路段，在大雾天气下以 45 英里/小时的速度行驶，即使低于限速，您也可能因“车速过快”而被罚款。

**26. Which of the following roadways freeze first when wet?【容易选错】**
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Bridges and overpasses</span>
- Intersections
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Tunnels</span>

> Bridges and overpasses tend to freeze before the rest of the road does.

**36. A person may legally ride in the back of a pickup truck when**
- The sides of the pickup bed are at least 24 inches high.
- The back of the pickup is covered with a camper shell.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ In a secured seat and while using an approved safety belt.</span>

> Do not allow a person to ride in the back of a pickup or other truck unless the vehicle is equipped with seats and the person uses both the seat and a safety belt. 除非车辆配备座椅，并且乘客同时使用座椅和安全带，否则不得允许任何人乘坐皮卡或其他卡车的后车厢。

- Should wait for the first two vehicles to pass, then drive into the lane.

> Any time that you merge into city or highway traffic, you should wait for a gap in traffic large enough for your vehicle to get up to the speed of other traffic. 无论何时并入城市或高速公路车流，都应该等待车流中出现足够大的空隙，使你的车辆能够加速到与其他车辆相同的速度。

**10. When changing lanes on a freeway, you should: Signal for at least five seconds.**

> Signal at least five seconds prior to a changing lanes on a freeway. Always signal when turning left or right, changing lanes, slowing down, or stopping to let other drivers, motorcyclists, bicyclists, and pedestrians know your intentions.  在高速公路上变换车道时，至少提前【五秒钟】打转向灯。左转、右转、变换车道、减速或停车时，务必打转向灯，以便其他驾驶员、摩托车驾驶员、自行车驾驶员和行人了解您的意图。

**12. When approaching a roundabout, you should always**
- Increase your speed.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Decrease your speed.</span>
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Maintain your speed.</span>

> When approaching a roundabout, slow down. A roundabout is designed to be driven at a low speed. 接近环岛时，请减速。环岛的设计目的是让车辆低速行驶。

**32. You should drive on the shoulder【靠路肩超车 -&gt; 非法】 to pass a car: =&gt; Under no circumstances.**

> Passing on the right is permissible only if it is possible to do so without driving off the roadway. Never pass another vehicle on the shoulder because the other driver will not expect you to be there and may pull off the road. 【只有在不驶离路面的情况下，才能从右侧超车】。切勿在路肩超车，因为对方司机不会预料到你会在那里，可能会驶离路面。

**35. You are approaching an intersection at the posted speed limit when the signal turns yellow. You should**
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Slow down and proceed through the intersection without caution.</span>
- Speed up to cross the intersection before the light turns red.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Stop before entering the intersection, if you can do so safely.</span>

> A solid yellow light means "caution" and signals that the light will soon turn red. You should stop at a solid yellow light if you can do so safely; otherwise, you should cautiously cross the intersection. 黄灯常亮表示“注意”，预示着信号灯即将变为红灯。如果安全，您应该在黄灯常亮时停车；否则，您应该谨慎通过路口。

**9. For which of the following traffic lights must you always stop your vehicle?**
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Solid red lights, flashing red lights, and blacked out traffic signals.</span>
- Solid red lights, red arrows, and flashing yellow lights.
- Solid red lights, flashing red lights, and yellow lights.

> You must stop at a solid or flashing red light, or at a signal light that is blacked out (not working). A solid yellow light means that the signal is about to turn red and you must stop if you can do so safely; otherwise, proceed cautiously. A flashing yellow light means that you should proceed with caution, but you do not need to stop. 遇到常亮或闪烁的红灯，或者信号灯熄灭（不亮）时，您必须停车。常亮的黄灯表示信号灯即将变为红灯，如果安全，您必须停车；否则，请谨慎行驶。闪烁的黄灯表示您应该谨慎行驶，但无需停车。

**17. Increase your following distance when driving behind a large vehicle:【记忆】**
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ To better see around the sides of the vehicle.</span>
- Because other drivers tend to pull behind large vehicles before trying to pass them.
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Because following too closely will get you caught in the vehicle's slipstream.</span>

> Drivers of trucks, buses, vans, and any vehicles pulling campers or trailers may not be able to see you if you are driving directly behind them. Increase your following distance when driving behind one of these vehicles. Additionally, large vehicles can block your view of the road, so increase your following distance to look around the sides of the vehicle and see the road ahead. 如果您紧跟在卡车、巴士、厢式货车以及任何牵引露营车或拖车的车辆后面，它们的驾驶员可能看不到您。因此，在跟在这些车辆后面行驶时，请增加跟车距离。此外，大型车辆可能会遮挡您的视线，因此请增加跟车距离，以便观察车辆两侧并看清前方路况。

**19. You are driving on the freeway. The vehicle in front of you is a large truck. You should drive**
- Closely behind the truck in bad weather because the driver can see farther ahead than you can.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Farther behind the truck than you would when following a passenger vehicle.</span>
- No more than one car length behind the truck so the driver can see you.

> When you follow so closely behind a truck that you cannot see the truck driver’s side view mirrors, the trucker cannot see you and has no way of knowing you are there. Tailgating a truck, or any vehicle, is dangerous because you take away your own cushion of safety if the vehicle in front of you stops quickly. 当你跟车过近，以至于看不到卡车司机的后视镜时，卡车司机也看不到你，根本无法察觉你的存在。紧跟卡车或其他任何车辆都是危险的，因为一旦前车急刹车，你自身的安全保障就会丧失殆尽。

**34. When parking your vehicle parallel to the curb on a level street: Your wheels must be within 18 inches of the curb. 车轮与路缘石的距离必须在 18 英寸以内。**

- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ In order to see potential hazards early.</span>
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Because it takes a quarter of a mile to stop your vehicle completely.</span>
- Because it helps you keep up with traffic.

> On the freeway, be ready for changes in traffic conditions. Watch for signals from other drivers. Expect merging vehicles at on-ramps and interchanges and be prepared for rapid changes in road conditions and traffic flow. 在高速公路上行驶时，要做好应对交通状况变化的准备。注意其他驾驶员的信号灯。预计在匝道和立交桥处会有车辆并入主路，并做好应对路况和交通流量快速变化的准备。

**34. Water on the road can cause a vehicle to hydroplane. Your car may hydroplane at speeds as low as:【拿不准】**

- Station wagon.
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Passenger vehicle.</span>
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Motorcycle.</span>

> Allow for extra space when driving behind a motorcycle. Motorcycles can stop more quickly than other vehicles can and you must have adequate room to stop if the motorcyclist brakes or falls off. Also, remember that motorcycles are difficult to see at night because they only have one tail light. 在摩托车后方行驶时，请预留额外的安全距离。摩托车的刹车距离比其他车辆更短，因此您必须有足够的空间，以便在摩托车驾驶员刹车或摔倒时能够及时停车。此外，请记住，摩托车在夜间难以辨认，因为它们只有一个尾灯。

**24. If you find that the roadway ahead of you is flooded, you should**
- Slam on the brakes.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Not drive through the flooded area. Turn around and find another route.</span>
- Drive only in the center of the roadway.

> Never attempt to drive on a flooded road. Even if the water looks shallow, it may hide many kinds of hazards. If you encounter a flooded area, turn around and seek another route to your destination. 切勿尝试在被洪水淹没的道路上行驶。即使水看起来很浅，也可能隐藏着各种危险。如果遇到被洪水淹没的区域，请掉头寻找其他路线前往目的地。

- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ The truck driver to stop the vehicle.</span>
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Other drivers when they want to slow down.</span>

> Because they are larger, trucks take longer to stop than cars traveling at the same speed. Other drivers should not pull in front of a truck and then slow down or stop. 由于卡车体积较大，因此与同等速度行驶的轿车相比，卡车刹车距离更长。其他驾驶员不应突然变道到卡车前方，然后减速或停车。

**20. U-turns in business districts are**
- Always illegal because they are dangerous.
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Legal whenever oncoming vehicles are not a hazard.</span>
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Legal at intersections【路口】, unless a sign prohibits them.</span>

> In a business district, you may make a U-turn only at an intersection, unless a sign prohibits it, or where openings are provided for turns. 在商业区，除非有标志禁止掉头，或者有掉头通道，否则【只能在十字路口掉头】。

**21. If you are being followed too closely on a two-lane road**
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Reduce your speed slowly to encourage the tailgater to drive around you.</span>【慢慢降低车速，促使尾随车辆超车。】
- Speed up to increase the distance between you and the other car.
- Apply your brakes to slow down, then resume your original speed.

> If you are being followed too closely by another driver, merge into a different lane. If there is no lane available for merging, wait until the road ahead is clear and slowly reduce your speed. This will encourage the tailgater to drive around you. 如果后面的车跟车太近，请并入其他车道。如果没有合适的车道可以并入，请等待前方道路畅通后再缓慢减速。这样可以促使跟车过近的车辆超车。

**35. Flash your brake lights or turn on your emergency flashers if you**
- Need to warn other drivers of a collision ahead.

> If you can see a collision ahead, warn the drivers behind you by turning on your emergency flashers or by tapping your brake pedal quickly three or four times. 如果前方有碰撞事故发生，请打开紧急闪光灯或快速踩刹车踏板三四次，以警告后方车辆的驾驶员。

- Turn the front wheels slightly to the left to edge the car back onto the pavement.				X 将前轮稍微向左转动，使汽车回到人行道上。
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Hold the steering wheel firmly, release the gas pedal, and gently apply the brakes.</span>
- Apply the brakes and turn the front wheels sharply to the left.

> If your vehicle leaves the roadway, hold the steering wheel firmly, release the gas pedal, and gently apply the brakes. Wait until your speed has reduced, check the traffic, and look for a place to safely return to the roadway by merging back into traffic. Overcompensating by jerking the wheel to return to the roadway can cause you to lose control of your vehicle or may cause your car to go into other lanes of traffic. 如果您的车辆驶离道路，请紧握方向盘，松开油门踏板，然后轻轻踩下刹车。等待车速降低后，观察路况，寻找安全并入车流的位置。猛打方向盘试图回到道路上可能会导致您失去对车辆的控制，或者车辆驶入其他车道。

- Steer off the road.
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Drive in a low gear.</span> 低档形式(档位)
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Steer and brake smoothly.</span>

> When driving during unfavorable weather conditions, avoid slamming on the brakes and making sharp, quick turns. These behaviors will make controlling your vehicle in inclement weather even more difficult. 在恶劣天气条件下驾驶时，应避免猛踩刹车和急转弯。这些行为会使您在恶劣天气下更难控制车辆。

**9. What is the benefit of a space cushion around your vehicle?**
- Other drivers can cut in front of you, improving the flow of traffic.
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ If another driver makes a mistake, you have time to react.</span>
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ It inflates to protect you from injury in the case of a collision.</span>

> Keeping space around your vehicle is important to ensure that you have time to safely react if another driver makes a mistake. For example, extra space around your vehicle may give you time to brake or maneuver out of the way of a vehicle veering into your lane. 保持与车辆周围的安全距离非常重要，这样才能确保您有时间在其他驾驶员犯错时安全应对。例如，额外的安全距离可以让您有时间刹车或避让突然变道的车辆。

**14. When changing lanes**
- <span style="color:#e11d48">✖ Rely on the rearview mirror.</span>
- <span style="color:#16a34a">✅ Look over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move.</span>
- Rely on the left side mirror.

> When changing lanes, glance over your shoulder to check for traffic in your blind spot. You may need to look several times before changing lanes. You must keep track of what traffic is doing in front of you as well as what traffic is doing in the lane next to you. 变换车道时，请回头查看盲区内的交通状况。变换车道前可能需要多次观察。您必须时刻关注前方和相邻车道的交通状况。

**16. You have been involved in a minor traffic collision with a parked vehicle and you can't find the owner. You must**
